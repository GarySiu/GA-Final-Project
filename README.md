# Magnetic Tweets
## Introduction
This project aims to combine the surrealist nonsense of markov chains 
(the algorithm behind many chatbots, spam mailers and the 
[Horse_ebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_ebooks) internet phenomenon),
with the cult 90's fridge magnet toy "[Magnetic Poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_Poetry)".
